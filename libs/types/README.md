# Types (@kanon-academy/types)

This library contains shared TypeScript types, interfaces, and enums used across different applications (e.g., `api`, `web`) in the monorepo.

Using this library helps ensure data consistency and type safety between the frontend and backend.

## Building

While you typically don't need to build this library directly as it's consumed in source format, you can run a build using:

```sh
nx build types
```
